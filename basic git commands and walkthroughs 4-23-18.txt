Creating a “Master” Local Git Repository (on your PC):

Create a folder
Add a .gitignore file
At the terminal:
git init
git status
git add --all (to stage files)
git commit -m “first commit”
git log


Creating an “Origin/Master” Remote Github Repository (on Github website):

Create a new repo
name it the same as the folder name of your local git repo
Not required, but logical
copy / paste instructions
navigate to the root of your local git repo
copy / paste the code given to you - one line at a time - into the terminal
Your code will look something like this:
git remote add origin git@github.com:GoesToEleven/webdog.git
git push -u origin master
master vs origin/master
The “master” branch
“origin/master” means “the master branch on the origin”, the source from which 
everyone is contributing
git push


Description:
We use github to create a remote github repository. There are many ways to do 
this. I am going to show you what I believe is the simplest, and best, method.



**Using Github - Basic Commands
**Here are the basic github commands which you will use 98% of the time:
git status
git add --all
git commit -m “some concise descriptive message”
git push
Description:
As we code, we will want to “push” our code and store it remotely on github. 
This will keep track of all of the code we are writing. To do this, we follow 
a few simple commands: git status, git add --all, git commit -m “some message”
, git push.




Using Github - Deleting A Repo
Delete locally
Delete remote origin on github (go to repo and settings and go to bottom of 
webpage)

Copy github repo to your local pc:
git clone url-of-repo
(this copies the repo is a new folder within the folder you are in and this 
is a master branch with hidden git file and is tracked by git, you don't have 
to run git init)
